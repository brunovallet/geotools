# geotools
Geometric tools, as solutions to interesting geometry problems
* shortest_path_circle: finds the shortest path touching an ordered sequence of circles, a problem from paragliding where some competitions give this constraint.
* RANSAC_circle: find circles from oriented individual positions, a problem also from paragliding to detect areas of high air vertical velocity as paragliders follow circles in these, and in most competitions, it is possible to access to their GPS info.
